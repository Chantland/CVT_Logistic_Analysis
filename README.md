# Matlab_Analysis
 Code used to Analyze versions of Choice Task (based of VOC task by Delgado et al 2000) using logistic regression


For Choice Valuation Task (CVT):
Participants choose whether or not they want to be in control. Analysis takes the expected value of these decisions and uses a logistic regression to calculate the point in which they are equally likely to defer or maintain control. There are 5 groups but only 4 are shown here and each is a slightly different condition.
Added file "CVT_SHORTENED_S" is a stripped version of the original data which used much more columns and subjects. 3 subjects are provided per group as an example of the code running.



For Choice Proficiency Task (CPT):
Data from participants choosing the probability they would succeed. As such the analysis is somewhat similar to CVT but the manipulation of the expected value is different.
Added file "CPT_Analysis_SHORTENED_S" is a 5 subject stripped version of the original data which used much more columns and subjects. These subjects were provided as an example of the code running.
